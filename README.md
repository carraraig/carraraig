I'm a Theoretical Physicist graduated from the University of Milan Bicocca. My academic education is based on a strong background in mathematics and statistics, with particular attention to numerical simulations. Moreover, I specialized in Machine Learning and Neural Network algorithms, with application to Big Data analysis. I decided to pursue a PhD in the area of computer science applied to neuroscience.  Specifically, I am involved in the development of new Machine Learning models for the Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on electroencephalogram (EEG).
